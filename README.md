## Key Features Implementation

### Match Score Algorithm

The match score calculates compatibility between user profiles and job postings based on:
- **Skills Match (40% weight)**: Compares user skills with job required skills
- **Tag/Interest Match (25% weight)**: Matches user interests with job tags
- **Experience Level (20% weight)**: Checks if user meets job experience requirements
- **Profile Completeness (15% weight)**: Evaluates how complete the user profile is

### Recommendation System

Jobs are recommended based on:
1. Match score (highest first)
2. Recency (newer posts prioritized)
3. User preferences and skills

### Database Structure

The application uses localStorage for demo purposes. Data structures include:
- **Users**: Email, password (hashed in production), name, skills, interests, experience level
- **Jobs**: Title, description, type, tags, required skills, status, analytics
- **Applications**: Job ID, user ID, message, status
- **Messages**: From/To user IDs, text, read status, timestamp

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**: Replace localStorage with a real database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
2. **Real-time Chat**: Implement WebSockets or Firebase for real-time messaging
3. **Push Notifications**: Add browser push notification support
4. **Email Verification**: Implement email verification flow
5. **Password Reset**: Add password reset functionality
6. **OAuth Integration**: Complete Google and GitHub OAuth integration
7. **File Uploads**: Add resume/CV upload functionality
8. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed analytics for job posters
9. **AI Matching**: Enhanced AI-powered job matching algorithm
